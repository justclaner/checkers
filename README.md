# About this Site

I made this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js to learn more about React state and how to program in it in general. The hardest part for me was learning the differences between React and vanilla javascript such as how variables and lists are no longer mutable. Another difficult part was the game logic, as the simplistic rules for the game were complex when put in codeâ€”especially for the chained jumps and checking for whether a move is possible.
